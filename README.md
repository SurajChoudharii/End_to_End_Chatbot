# 🤖 End-to-End AI Chatbot

This project demonstrates the development of an end-to-end chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand user intent and generate appropriate responses, mimicking basic human interaction.

## 📌 Project Description

The chatbot is capable of:

- Understanding user queries through intent classification
- Responding with appropriate replies from a predefined set
- Learning from conversational patterns using NLP pipelines
- Providing a simple but scalable framework for chatbot development

This project includes complete preprocessing, model training, and prediction using a feedforward neural network.

## 🧠 Techniques & Features

- Tokenization and Lemmatization  
- Bag of Words & TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Intent Classification using Neural Networks  
- Model training using Keras/TensorFlow  
- JSON-based response architecture

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- NLTK  
- NumPy & Pandas  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
